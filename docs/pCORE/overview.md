# pCORE Overview

pCORE is a liquid staking token (LST) that represents staked CORE tokens in the Corepilot protocol. It allows users to maintain liquidity while earning staking rewards from the CORE blockchain's Satoshi Plus Consensus mechanism.

## What is pCORE?

pCORE is an ERC20 token that serves as a receipt for CORE tokens staked through the Corepilot platform. When you stake CORE tokens via Corepilot, you receive pCORE tokens in return, which:

- **Represent your staked CORE**: Each pCORE token represents a proportional share of the total CORE staked in the Corepilot protocol
- **Accrue staking rewards**: The value of pCORE increases over time as staking rewards are earned
- **Maintain liquidity**: Unlike traditional staking, pCORE can be traded, transferred, or used in DeFi applications
- **Enable composability**: pCORE can be integrated into other protocols and applications
