# How pCORE Works

## 1. Deposit Process

```mermaid

    A["User Stakes CORE"] --> B["Corepilot Protocol"]
    B --> C["Distribute to Validators"]
    B --> D["Mint pCORE to User"]
    C --> E["Earn Rewards"]
    E --> F["Increase pCORE Value"]
```

1. **Deposit CORE**: Users deposit CORE or WCORE tokens into the Corepilot protocol
2. **Automatic Distribution**: The protocol distributes CORE to optimal validators
3. **Receive pCORE**: Users receive pCORE tokens representing their stake
4. **Earn Rewards**: Rewards accrue to the protocol, increasing pCORE value

#### Example

- User has 150 WCORE
- Current exchange rate is 1.5
- Deposit 150 WCORE, user will receive 100 pCORE (150 / 1.5)

## 2. Exchange Rate Mechanism

The pCORE to CORE exchange rate increases over time as staking rewards are earned:

```
Exchange Rate = (Total CORE Staked + Accumulated Rewards) / Total pCORE Supply
```

### Example

- **Initial State**: 1,000 CORE staked â†’ 1,000 pCORE minted â†’ Exchange Rate = 1.00
- **After Rewards**: 1,500 CORE (1,000 + 500 rewards) â†’ 1,000 pCORE â†’ Exchange Rate = 1.5
- **User Benefit**: Each pCORE token is now worth 1.5 CORE

### Value Appreciation Workflow

## 3. Redeem Process

Users can always redeem their pCORE tokens for CORE at the current exchange rate. Example: If the current exchange rate is 1.5, redeeming 100 pCORE will return 150 CORE. There are 2 redemption modes: **normal redeem** and **instant redeem**

### 3.1. Normal Redeem

- **Request redeem**: Submit a withdrawal request by burning pCORE tokens
- **Waiting Period**: 24-hour delay before CORE tokens can be claimed
- **Claim Tokens**: After waiting period, claim your CORE tokens at the locked exchange rate

#### Example

- User has 100 pCORE
- Current exchange rate is 1.5 when request is made
- **Step 1**: Request withdrawal â†’ pCORE burned
- **Step 2**: Wait 24 hours for processing
- **Step 3**: Claim 150 CORE (100 Ã— 1.5)

### 3.2. Instant Redeem (No unlock period)

Instant redemption lets users withdraw CORE immediately to their wallet without any redemption period (with a 10% fee).

#### Example

- User has 100 pCORE
- Current exchange rate is 1.5 when request is made
- Total: 150 CORE (100 Ã— 1.5), user will immediately receive 135 CORE (150 x 0.9)

## 4. Deposit/Redeem Restrictions & Dues Protection

The Core staking contract enforces these rules:

- When delegating CORE, the amount must be >= 1 CORE.
- When undelegating CORE:
  - The amount must be >= 1 CORE, and
  - The remaining CORE left on a validator of this address must be >= 1 or = 0.

Since these restrictions also apply to pCORE, it must adhere to the same rules when executing all deposit, mint, redeem, withdraw operations.

## 5. Validator Selection & Optimization

- **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous tracking of validator performance metrics
- **APY Optimization**: Automatic rebalancing to maximize returns
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluation of validator reliability and history

## 6. Reward Accumulation

- **Real-time Accrual**: Rewards are continuously added to the vault
- **No Manual Action**: Users don't need to claim or restake rewards
- **Compound Growth**: Rewards earn additional rewards over time

## 7. Share Calculation

- **Shares Received**: `deposit_amount Ã— total_shares / total_assets`
- **Assets Received**: `shares_burned Ã— total_assets / total_shares`
- **Preview Functions**: Users can preview exact amounts before transactions
